# rubiks-robot-master

Overview:

  This is a personal project made by Lucas Willcock (myself obviously). The immediate goal is too build a robot in python that can
  solve a rubiks cube with human given inputs faster than a human. The end goal is whatever I want it to be, camera recognition of the mix? A bit more mechanical engineering plus a couple RGB sensors?
  
Current Progress:

  A rough interface has been designed, program can solve a mix and control stepper motors correctly and accurately.
  
To do:

  - Make a cleaner and smarter GUI
  - Add all my schematics etc to github
  - 3D CAD designs for all individual parts of the mechanical product
  - Write a motor control class in a seperate file
  - Refine solving method (less if statements)
  - Figure out a better way of semlessly moving between pi and Mac (GPIO class)

Way further to do:

  - Redo it all in C/C++ for use with a micro
